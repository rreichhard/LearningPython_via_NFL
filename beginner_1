# establish the dictionary

        "name": "Michael Thomas",
        "catches": 149,
        "targets": 185
    },
    {
        "name": "Julio Jones",
        "catches": 99,
        "targets": 157
    },
    {
        "name": "Davante Adams",
        "catches": 83,
        "targets": 127
    }
]
for player in players:
    name = player['name']
    catches = player['catches']
    targets = player['targets']
    catch_rate = catches/targets
    print(name + ' had a catch rate of ' + str(catch_rate))
